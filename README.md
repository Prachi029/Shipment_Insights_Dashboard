# Shipment_Insights_Dashboard
## Overview
This project offers a comprehensive analysis of a shipping dataset, aiming to provide insights into various business metrics and delivery dynamics. Through two interactive dashboards, we delve into the nuances of the shipping process, uncovering patterns and trends that can guide businesses in optimizing their operations and enhancing customer satisfaction.

## Dashboards
### 1. Overview of the Dataset: Business Metrics Snapshot
This dashboard serves as an introductory glance into the dataset, capturing the essence of key business metrics. It is designed to provide stakeholders with a quick and comprehensive understanding of the company's operations. Features of this dashboard include:

**Distributions:** Visual distributions of various parameters such as:
* Mode of Shipment
* Gender Distribution of Customers
* Product Importance Levels
* Customer Ratings

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
* Average Cost of Product
* Average Customer Care Calls
* Total Shipments
* On-Time Deliveries
* Delayed Shipments
* Average Rating

**Navigation:** A strategically placed magnifying glass icon at the top right allows users to delve deeper, leading them to the second dashboard for a more detailed analysis.

### 2. Navigating Delivery Successes & Setbacks
This dashboard is a deep dive into the intricacies of the shipping process. It's tailored to provide insights that can help in identifying successes and potential areas of improvement. Key features include:

* **On-Time vs. Delayed Shipments**: A clear visual representation that showcases the efficiency and potential bottlenecks in the delivery process.

* **Discount Analysis**: An exploration into the relationship between the discounts offered and on-time deliveries. This can help in understanding if higher discounts are potentially leading to delivery challenges.

* **Interactive Filtering:** Users can interactively filter data based on the mode of shipment (Ship, Flight, Road). This dynamic feature ensures that stakeholders can view data tailored to their specific interests, providing a more focused analysis.

* **Navigation:** Seamless navigation back to the first dashboard ensures users can easily switch between a holistic view and a detailed analysis.

## Tools & Technologies
**Tableau:** The primary tool used for designing the interactive dashboards and visualizations. Leveraging Tableau's capabilities, these dashboards offer dynamic and insightful visual representations of the dataset.
## How to Use
* **Navigation:** Start by choosing the dashboard you're interested in exploring.
* **Interactivity:** Engage with the visual components to delve deeper into specific metrics or to view data from different angles.
* **Customization:** Use the filters or selectors to tailor the data view based on your criteria. For instance, in the "Navigating Delivery Successes & Setbacks" dashboard, you can filter data by the mode of shipment.


This project is designed to offer a comprehensive view of shipping operations, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions and identifying areas of improvement.
